# Cartographer

Cartographer is a small library for loading Tiled maps in LÃ–VE. It provides simple functionality for drawing layers, and it provides a couple of generally useful shortcuts for using Tiled maps.

## Installation

To use Cartographer, place cartographer.lua in your project, and then add this code to your main.lua:

```lua
cartographer = require 'cartographer' -- if your cartographer.lua is in the root directory
cartographer = require 'path.to.cartographer' -- if it's in subfolders
```

## Usage

### Loading a map

```lua
map = cartographer.load(path)
```

Loads a Tiled map in Lua format.
- `path` - the path to the map to load.

### Drawing the entire map

```lua
map:draw()
```

### Accessing layers by name

```lua
map.layers[name]
```

While you can access layers by numerical index as usual, Cartographer allows you to access layers by name as well.

### Drawing individual layers

```lua
map.layers[name]:draw()
```

### Getting the size of the map in pixels

```lua
local width = map:getPixelWidth()
local height = map:getPixelHeight()
```
